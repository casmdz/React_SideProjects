passing functions via props 

in a real world application, something should happen after an ittem is selected

but we need to make it reusable, so it shouldnt be hardcoded in ListGroup.tsx componenet

Notify the consumer (the parent) (APP.tsx) of Listgroup componenet that the item is selected 


We've been using Props to pass data to LG. We can make a 3d property a function


PROPS =
input passed to a component 
similar to function args 
treat it as IMMUTABLE (unchangeable/ read only) 



STATE = 
data managed by the component
can change over time 
similar to local variables inside a function 

Both cause a re-render 



PASSING CHILDREN 
like how we pass a list group in the div in app 

-create Alert.tsx 

-rafce 
rafce = react arrow function export component 


    <br />

    <Message />
    <ListGroup items={items} heading={headerText} onSelectItem={handleSelectItem}/> 



BUILDING A BUTTON COMPONENT 

https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/#handling-clicks

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    alert('clicked');
  }}
>
  Click me
</Button>



Customization
Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the overrides documentation page. 
https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/#customization


Prompt: Create a React component that renders a Material-UI button. When the button is clicked, it should change its appearance (e.g., change the background color) or display a message on the screen. You can also include a counter to track how many times the button has been clicked.

Binding element 'onPress' implicitly has an 'any' type.




trying out dialogue boxes instead of a modal 

https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/#customization



https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/




using customization dialog 
just like our phonebook modal 

we're programming the content 
and if open: return that content 


<p>The bumblebee bat is the world's smallest mammal</p>
<p>Beavers have orange teeth, as they contain a lot of iron. The mineral makes the teeth particularly resistant to external forces.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sunt, dignissimos natus illo omnis doloremque impedit qui, modi aliquam quas reiciendis fugit.</p>



<Typography paragraph={true} sx={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-line'}}>
The bumblebee bat is the world's smallest mammal.

Beavers have orange teeth, as they contain a lot of iron. The mineral makes the teeth particularly resistant to external forces.
